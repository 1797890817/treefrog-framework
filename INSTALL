    Windows:

      Run the following commands in Qt Command Prompt.
       > cd treefrog-x.x.x
       > configure --enable-debug
       > cd src
       > mingw32-make install
       > cd ..\tools
       > mingw32-make instal
       > cd ..
       > configure
       > cd src
       > mingw32-make install
       > cd ..\tools
       > mingw32-make instal
    
    Linux, Mac OS X, or Unix-like OS:
      Run the following commands.
       $ cd treefrog-x.x.x
       $ ./configure
       $ cd src
       $ make
       $ sudo make install
       $ cd ../tools
       $ make
       $ sudo make install

3. Create a shortcut to TreeFrog Command Prompt (on Windows only).
   Locate the program:
     C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /K C:\TreeFrog\x.x.x\bin\tfenv.bat
     ("x.x.x" is version)

   * In the TreeFrog Command Prompt, build Web applications and run
     TreeFrog commands such as tspawn or treefrog.
