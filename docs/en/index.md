## <i class="fa fa-bolt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Small but Powerful and Efficient

TreeFrog Framework is a high-speed and full-stack C++ framework for developing Web applications, which supports HTTP and WebSocket protocol.

Web applications can run faster than that of scripting language because the server-side framework was written in C++/Qt. In application development, it provides an O/R mapping system and template systems on an MVC architecture, aims to achieve high productivity through the policy of  convention over configuration.


## <i class="fa fa-flag" aria-hidden="true"></i> Features

  1. High performance - Highly optimized Application server engine of C++.
  2. O/R mapping  - Conceals complex and troublesome database accesses
  3. Template system  - ERB-like template engine
  4. Support for many DB - MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
  5. Cross-platform  - Same source code can work on Windows, macOS and Linux
  6. Support WebSocket - Providing full-duplex communications channels
  7. Generator - Automatically generates scaffolds and Makefiles
  8. Less resource -  Stable operation even on Raspberry Pi
  9. OSS  - New BSD License


## <i class="fa fa-comment" aria-hidden="true"></i> Selecting TreeFrog Framework

It is said that there is a trade-off relationship between development efficiency and operation speed in web application development, is it really true?

There is not such a thing. it is possible to develop efficiently by providing convenient development tools and excellent libraries from the framework and by specifying specifications to minimize the configuration file.

In recent years, cloud computing has emerged, the importance of Web applications is increasing year by year. Although it is known that the execution speed of the script language decreases as the amount of code increases, C++ language can operate at the fastest speed with a small memory footprint and does not decrease execution speed even as the amount of code increases.

Multiple application servers running in scripting language can be aggregated into one without degrading performance.
Try TreeFrog Framework which combines high productivity and high speed operation!
